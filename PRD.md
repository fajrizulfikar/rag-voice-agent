PRD: Voice-Powered RAG FAQ Agent
1. Overview
Build an AI-powered voice assistant backend using NestJS, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and a vector database. The voice agent transcribes user speech, retrieves relevant documents using semantic search, generates answers with an LLM, and responds via text-to-speech. Admin interface supports FAQ/document uploads.

2. Features
Core User Features
Voice Input: Accept user questions via microphone (speech-to-text).

Semantic Search: Query vector database for closest match(es) to user’s question (RAG workflow).

Answer Generation: Use LLM (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) to generate answers using retrieved context.

Voice Output: Convert generated answers to speech for playback (text-to-speech).

Fallback to Text Input/Output: Allow typed questions and answers for environments without voice.

Admin Features
Upload/update FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and docs.

View query logs (who asked, what was answered).

Re-index vector DB after content updates.

3. Technical Specifications
Backend: NestJS (Node.js)

Vector DB: Qdrant, Milvus, or Pinecone (API-based, vendor-neutral)

LLM Provider: OpenAI, Claude, or other pluggable LLM

Speech Services: Google Speech, Azure Speech, or free library alternatives

Frontend (Optional): Next.js web demo, or CLI client

4. User Stories
User

“As a user, I want to ask by voice or text and get an accurate answer.”

“As a user, I want voice output for hands-free interactions.”

Admin

“As an admin, I want to manage FAQs and see query logs.”

5. API Endpoints (suggestion)
POST /voice-query: Accepts audio, returns speech and text answer

POST /text-query: Accepts question (text), returns answer

POST /admin/upload-doc: Admin uploads FAQ or document

GET /admin/query-log: Admin views logs

POST /admin/reindex: Trigger vector DB re-index

6. Acceptance Criteria
RAG pipeline retrieves and uses vector database content for answer generation.

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech work reliably for queries and responses.

Knowledge base updates are reflected in retrieval results.

API endpoints return correct, context-aware answers.

7. Stretch Goals
“Was this answer helpful?” feedback API

Multi-modal input support (images/screenshots)

Analytics dashboard for admin

Plug-in support for different vector DBs or LLMs

8. Deliverables
Source code: NestJS backend, API docs, setup guide

Demo client: CLI or simple web demo

Sample knowledge base: Seed docs for testing (sample FAQs, guides)
